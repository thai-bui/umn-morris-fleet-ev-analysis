# UMN Morris Fleet Fuel Usage & EV Transition Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This was a project I lead during my time as a Sustainability Data Analyst Intern at the University of Minnesota.
The project analyzes **three years of fleet ethanol billing data (FY22‚ÄìFY24)** from the University of Minnesota - Morris Campus to identify **opportunities for electrification**.  
I consolidated billing records, standardized vehicle information, and developed a **prioritization framework** to rank vehicles for EV replacement.  

**Tools:** Excel, R (dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, readxl, writexl), Tableau  
**Deliverables:** Clean dataset, Tableau dashboard, prioritization scorecard

## üéØ Problem Statement
UMN as a system is committed to **carbon neutrality by 2050**.  
The Morris fleet contributes significantly to campus emissions, but **no unified dataset** existed for decision-making.  
This project answers:  
- Which departments and vehicle types consume the most fuel?  
- How do usage patterns compare across model years?  
- Which vehicles are the **best EV replacement candidates**?

## üîÑ Data Workflow
Raw data: ethanol billing records (FY22‚ÄìFY24), vehicle inventory list, grounds equipment list.  

**Key Cleaning Steps:**
- Standardized **Vehicle_IDs** (fixed leading zeros, merged across systems).  
- Classified **On Road vs Off Road** based on ID structure.  
- Harmonized **department codes** using already available `Dpt` and `Usage` columns.  
- Added vehicle attributes: **Duty Type, Model Year, Fuel Efficiency**.  
- Created derived fields: **Mileage = Gallons √ó Fuel Efficiency**, **Fiscal Year (FY)**.  

üìÇ Clean dataset exported as:  
`/data/processed/Ethanol Billing Combined Clean.xlsx`  

Scripts:  
- [`01_cleaning.R`](scripts/01_cleaning.R)  
- [`02_prioritization.R`](scripts/02_prioritization.R)

## üìä Dashboard & Visuals
All visualizations built in **Tableau**. Packaged workbook:  
[`Morris Fleet Fuel Tableau Public Dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thai.bui1819/viz/MorrisFleetFuel/Dashboard?publish=yes) 

### Key Insights:
1. **Fuel Usage by Department**
   ![](figures/dept_usage.png)  
   Facilities Management and Rental Fleet together consume ~85% of total gallons.  

2. **Duty Type**
   ![](figures/duty_type.png)  
   SUVs and Sedans has the highest fuel usage per vehicle ‚Üí strong EV pilot candidates.  

3. **FM Sub-Departments**
   ![](figures/fm_subdept.png)  
   HVAC vehicles dominate Facilities‚Äô fuel use.  

4. **Model Year**
   ![](figures/model_year.png)  
   Pre-2015 vehicles are inefficient; 2018‚Äì21 vehicles are heavily utilized.  

5. **Utilization vs Efficiency by Department**
   ![](figures/scatter_usage_efficiency.png)  
   Facilities Management's vehicles has the highest fuel usage as a fleet as well as per vehicle

6. **Top Fuel-Consuming Vehicles**

## üßÆ Prioritization Framework
I created a composite score to rank vehicles for EV replacement:  
Priority Score = (0.30 * Age) + (0.25 * FuelUse) + (0.2 * Utilization) + (0.2 * EVFit) + (0.05 * Winter Suitability)
- **FuelUse**: share of total gallons (0‚Äì100).  
- **Utilization**: miles/year (estimated).  
- **Age**: years since model year (the older the vehicle, the higher the score)  
- **EVFit**: availiblity of EV products by duty type (e.g., sedans = high, medium trucks = low).  
- **Winter Suitability**: cold-weather reliability proxy.

üìÇ Outputs:  
- [`Top10_Priority.xlsx`](output/Top10_Priority.xlsx) ‚Äî top 15 vehicles with recommended action.  
- [`Unit Summary.xlsx`](output/Dept_Priority.xlsx) ‚Äî the entire list of vehicles and their Prioritation Score 

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
- **Departments**: Focus electrification pilots in **Facilities Management** and **Rental Fleet**.  
- **Vehicle Types**: Start with **SUVs, Sedans, and Cargo Vans**.  
- **Top 10 Vehicles**: Start looking at opportunities within this list.
- Delay electrification of **Medium Trucks** until commercial EV options improve.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- Fuel billing records were collected across multiple sources without a standardized process, resulting in inconsistent IDs and department codes.
- There were a considerable number of null values in certain niche fields (e.g., usage notes, sub-department tags), requiring assumptions and business rules to fill gaps.
- Mileage estimated from fuel efficiency √ó gallons (no odometer data).  
- Charger proximity not yet included.  
- Winter suitability values based on secondary research (AAA 2019, DOE INL 2019).  
- Raw billing data not uploaded due to privacy.
